<h5>Calibration of Ammeter</h5>
<ul>

 
<li>Make the connections as per circuit diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    The loads have to increase step by step by the single pole switches </li>
  <li>
 
Take at least six observations by changing the load up to full scale deflection of the given ammeter. </li>
 <li>
   Note the readings of testing values and standard values at every step.</li>
<li> 
Calculate percentage error in each case.</li></ol>
<h5>Calibration of Voltmeter:</h5>
<ul>
 <li>
   Make the connections as per circuit diagram. </li>
 
  <li>Adjust rheostat such that testing voltmeter is reading a low value. </li>
 
<li>Take at least six observations by changing the rheostat up to full scale deflection of thegiven voltmeter. </li>
 
  <li>Note the readings of testing values and standard values at every step. </li>
 
  <li>Calculate percentage error in each case.</li>
  </ul>
